# SEG2105_Assignment5

This calculator was made using Android Studio 4.0.1 using Java Version 8 Update 241.
It is an updated version of Professor Garzon's Simple Calculator lab assignment, which was used as the basis for this project.
The base code can be found through the Univeristy of Ottawa's Brightspace link if a student of the course this was created under, or by contacting the origional author.
It is designed to do basic operations and calculations and has 2 modes as detailed below.

<b>Updated Code Info and Author</b>
 This simple calculator implements both a standard and scientific display orientation.
 It follows standard conventions for order of operations
 When in portrait orientation the calculator will be in standard mode.
 When in landscape orientation the calculator will be in scientific mode.
 Operations available in both modes:
      numbers 0-9
      addition
      clear
      division
      equals
      multiplication
      additive inverse
      subtraction
 Operations only available in scientific mode:
      factorials
      natural logarithm
      logarithm base 10
      modulo
      power
      square root
      scientific notation
      square

	<b>ALL ACTIONS AFTER THIS COMMENT ARE SHARED BETWEEN BOTH PORTRAIT (NORMAL) AND LANDSCAPE (SCIENTIFIC) STATES.
	ANY INPUT WILL BE EITHER RETAINED ON THE SCREENS OR IN THE LIST OF VARIABLES</b>
        
        <b>BUTTON 0 THROUGH 9 ACTION ON CLICK</b>
        IF ENTERED THROUGH ERROR STATE WILL SET SCREEN 1 TO BLANK AND ERROR STATE TO FALSE
        IF SPECIAL OPERATIONS ARE ACTIVE NUMBER BUTTONS BECOME INACTIVE PREVENTING ODD INPUTS
		EG: LOG(5)5.
        WHEN BUTTON PRESSED OUTPUTS SPECIFIED NUMBER TO BOTH SCREENS
        SETS NUM TO TRUE
        
        <b>DECIMAL ACTION ON CLICK</b>
        IF DEC IS ALREADY SET RETURNS PERFORMING NO ACTION PREVENTING ODD BEHAVIOUS
		EG: 5.5.5
              	EG: LOG(5).4
        INPUTS A DECIMAL ON BOTH SCREENS AFTER THE PREVIOUSLY PRESSED NUMBER
        SETS DEC TO TRUE
     
        <b>ADD ACTION ON CLICK</b>
        IF ENTERED THROUGH ERROR STATE WILL SET SCREEN 1 TO BLANK AND ERROR STATE TO FALSE
        PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING IF SCREEN 1 IS NOT BLANK:

              	SETS ADD TO TRUE, DEC TO FALSE, EQL TO FALSE AND RUNS NEGATEBOOL METHOD
              	FINALLY, EMPTIES SCREEN 1
        
        <b>CLEARS ALL DATA ON CLICK, I.E.:</b>
		CLEARS BOTH SCREENS(BLANK)
              	RESETS THE VARIABLES TO START VALUES
		CLEARS THE LIST, RESETTING IT TO EMPTY
        
	<b>DIVIDE ACTION ON CLICK</b>
        IF ENTERED THROUGH ERROR STATE WILL SET SCREEN 1 TO BLANK AND ERROR STATE TO FALSE
        IF SCREEN 1 IS NOT BLANK PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:

	<b>EQUAL ACTION ON CLICK</b>
        IF ONE OF THE OPERATION BOOLEAN ACTIONS IS ACTIVE
        IT ADDS THE PREVIOUSLY PRESSED NUMBER TO THE LIST
        IF THE LIST IS EVEN LENGTH THEN EQUALS IS NOT CARRIED OUT,
        AS THIS MEANS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH VARIABLE IN THE LIST
        THE ACTION WILL THEN GO THROUGH THE LIST FOLLOWING ORDER OF OPERATIONS,
        REMOVING OPERATION SYMBOLS AS THEY COME UP FOLLOWED BY SURROUNDING NUMBERS.
        THE EQUATION IS THEN CARRIED OUT AND THE NEXT OPERATION IS FOUND.
		IF 2 OPERATIONS ARE FOUND TOGETHER AN ERROR OCCURS
		IF THE USER ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE BY 0 AN ERROR OCCURS
            	THIS CALCULATOR HAS CHOSEN TO GO BY THE COMMON CONCEPTION THAT MOD0 WILL PRODUCE AN ERROR
        ADDS THE SYMBOL = TO SCREEN 2, THEN OUTPUT THE TOTAL TO BOTH SCREENS
        SETS DEC TO TRUE, EQL TO TRUE AND ALL OPERATION BOOLEAN VALUES TO FALSE
        
        @exception Symbols Out Of Sequence if user inputs two sequential operators
