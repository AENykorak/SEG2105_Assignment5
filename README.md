# Simple Calculator

This calculator was made using Android Studio 4.0.1 using Java Version 8 Update 241.<br>
It is an updated version of Professor Garzon's Simple Calculator lab assignment, which was used as the basis for this project.<br>
The base code can be found through the Univeristy of Ottawa's Brightspace link if a student of the course this was created under, or by contacting the origional author.<br>
It is designed to do basic operations and calculations and has 2 modes as detailed below.<br>

To test or edit the program download Android Studio and open the repository file SImple_Calculator as a project. This will allow you to see the code for the program.<br>
To run it, under AVD manager, use Nexus S API 30 as a virtual device and run the app.<br>
* Under the source files for the program layout\activity_main.xml is the layout code for the portrait, or Normal mode, and layout-land\activity_main.xml is the layout for the landscape, or Scientific mode.These two files control the general layout and aesthetics for the calculator.<br>
* The MainActivity.java file is the code for the operation of the calculator. It holds the running and helper methods that allow it to function. Any additional features should be implimented here.<br>
* Lastley, the AndroidManifest.xml file is what controls the general operation of the app. This is where the orientation feature was implimented to function off the sensor within the phone.<br>

### Umple Files
An Umple file has been included in the repository and can be used at http://cruise.eecs.uottawa.ca/umpleonline/.<br>
It shows the general operation and action sequence of the calculator to get a basic understanding of how each button should interact with the next.<br>

## Updated Code Info and Author
This simple calculator implements both a standard and scientific display orientation.<br>
It follows standard conventions for order of operations<br>
When in portrait orientation the calculator will be in standard mode.<br>
When in landscape orientation the calculator will be in scientific mode.<br>

Operations available in both modes:
* numbers 0-9
* addition
* clear
* division
* equals
* multiplication
* additive inverse
* subtraction<br>

Operations only available in scientific mode:
* factorials
* natural logarithm
* logarithm base 10
* modulo
* power
* square root
* scientific notation
* square<br>

**ALL ACTIONS AFTER THIS COMMENT ARE SHARED BETWEEN BOTH PORTRAIT (NORMAL) AND LANDSCAPE (SCIENTIFIC) STATES.<br>
ANY INPUT WILL BE EITHER RETAINED ON THE SCREENS OR IN THE LIST OF VARIABLES**

### BUTTON 0 THROUGH 9 ACTION ON CLICK
IF ENTERED THROUGH ERROR STATE WILL SET SCREEN 1 TO BLANK AND ERROR STATE TO FALSE<br>
IF SPECIAL OPERATIONS ARE ACTIVE NUMBER BUTTONS BECOME INACTIVE PREVENTING ODD INPUTS<br>
* EG: LOG(5)5.<br>

WHEN BUTTON PRESSED OUTPUTS SPECIFIED NUMBER TO BOTH SCREENS<br>
SETS NUM TO TRUE<br>

### DECIMAL ACTION ON CLICK  
IF DEC IS ALREADY SET RETURNS PERFORMING NO ACTION PREVENTING ODD BEHAVIOURS<br>
* EG: 5.5.5
* EG: LOG(5).4<br>

INPUTS A DECIMAL ON BOTH SCREENS AFTER THE PREVIOUSLY PRESSED NUMBER<br>
SETS DEC TO TRUE<br>

### ADD ACTION ON CLICK
IF ENTERED THROUGH ERROR STATE WILL SET SCREEN 1 TO BLANK AND ERROR STATE TO FALSE<br>
PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING IF SCREEN 1 IS NOT BLANK:<br>
* ADDS THE PREVIOUSLY PRESSED NUMBER TO THE LIST,
* FOLLOWED BY THE SYMBOL +
* THEN ADDS THE SYMBOL + AT THE END OF SCREEN 2
* SETS ADD TO TRUE, DEC TO FALSE, EQL TO FALSE AND RUNS NEGATEBOOL METHOD
* FINALLY, EMPTIES SCREEN 1<br>

### EQUAL ACTION ON CLICK
IF ONE OF THE OPERATION BOOLEAN ACTIONS IS ACTIVE AND SCREEN 1 IS NOT BLANK<br>
PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:<br>

* THE ACTION WILL THEN GO THROUGH THE LIST FOLLOWING ORDER OF OPERATIONS,
* REMOVING OPERATION SYMBOLS AS THEY COME UP FOLLOWED BY SURROUNDING NUMBERS.
* THE EQUATION IS THEN CARRIED OUT AND THE NEXT OPERATION IS FOUND.
  * IF THE USER ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE BY 0 AN ERROR OCCURS
  * THIS CALCULATOR HAS CHOSEN TO GO BY THE COMMON CONCEPTION THAT MOD0 WILL PRODUCE AN ERROR
* OUTPUTS THE TOTAL TO BOTH SCREENS
* SETS DEC TO TRUE, EQL TO TRUE AND ALL OPERATION BOOLEAN VALUES TO FALSE<br>

ERROR -  IF AN INPUT EQUAL TO 0 IS PASSED TO THE ACTION AND DIVISION IS ATTEMPTED AN ERROR MESSAGE OF
"CANNOT DIVIDE BY 0" IS DISPLAYED AND AN ERROR STATE IS INVOKED.<br>
